# Calla Development Plan

## Epic 1: Core Architecture

### - Subtask 1.1: Define DSL (.cla) Schema
  - Research existing DSL designs for API and service definitions.
  - Decide on the core components (models, services, fields, etc.) to be supported.
  - Create a formal specification for `.cla`.

### - Subtask 1.2: Lexical Analysis and Parsing
  - Develop a lexer to tokenize `.cla` files.
  - Implement a parser to construct an AST from the tokens.
  - Add unit tests for lexer and parser.

### - Subtask 1.3: AST Transformations and Validations
  - Validate the AST against the schema.
  - Transform AST into an intermediate representation if necessary.
  
### - Subtask 1.4: Configuration Management
  - Design a configuration management system.
  - Implement database configurations, rate-limiting, caching, etc.

### - Subtask 1.5: Error Handling
  - Define a global error handling mechanism.
  - Implement logging and debugging support.

## Epic 2: Code Generation

### - Subtask 2.1: Generate Models
  - Implement code generation for models based on `.cla` definitions.

### - Subtask 2.2: Generate Services
  - Implement code generation for services.
  - Generate CRUD operations, hooks, etc. based on `.cla` definitions.

### - Subtask 2.3: Generate Validators
  - Implement code generation for field validators.
  - Integrate with generated models.

### - Subtask 2.4: Testing
  - Implement a testing framework for generated code.
  - Generate sample tests based on .cla definitions.

## Epic 3: Language Server and Editor Support

### - Subtask 3.1: Language Server
  - Develop a language server protocol (LSP) for `.cla`.
  - Implement syntax highlighting, linting, and autocompletion.

### - Subtask 3.2: VSCode Extension
  - Create a VSCode extension that uses the LSP.
  - Publish the extension to the VSCode marketplace.

---

## Epic 4: CLI and Distribution

### - Subtask 4.1: CLI Tooling
  - Implement CLI for parsing, validating, and generating code.
  - Add CLI commands for testing, and debugging.

### - Subtask 4.2: Packaging and Distribution
  - Implement scripts for packaging CLI into various formats (npm, brew, deb, rpm, etc.)
  - Set up distribution channels for CLI.

### - Subtask 4.3: Version Management
  - Implement a version management strategy for the CLI.
  - Add backward compatibility and migration paths for different versions.

## Epic 5: Additional Features

### - Subtask 5.1: File Upload and Download
  - Add support for file operations in `.cla`.
  - Implement generated code for file handling.

### - Subtask 5.2: WebSockets
  - Add support for WebSockets in `.cla`.
  - Implement generated code for WebSocket endpoints.

### - Subtask 5.3: Rate Limiting and Caching
  - Implement code generation for rate limiting and caching based on `.cla` definitions.

### - Subtask 5.4: Third-party Services
  - Allow for integration with third-party services like AWS S3, Redis, etc. in `.cla`.

## Epic 6: Documentation and Examples

### - Subtask 6.1: Documentation
  - Write comprehensive documentation covering .cla syntax, code generation, and features.

### - Subtask 6.2: Examples
  - Create example projects showcasing the capabilities of Calla.

### - Subtask 6.3: Tutorials
  - Develop tutorials and guides to help new users get started with Calla.

---

## Epic 7: Testing and Deployment

### - Subtask 7.1: Unit Testing
  - Verify unit tests for all core components and utilities.

### - Subtask 7.2: Integration Testing
  - Implement end-to-end tests to validate the entire code generation process and runtime behavior.

### - Subtask 7.3: CI/CD Pipeline
  - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
